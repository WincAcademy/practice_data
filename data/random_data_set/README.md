# Random data set

The Python file uses Panda to generate a dataframe with some random data.

The dataset represents the data a chain of supermarkets created and contains
the following columns:

- datetime
- total_amount
- number_of_products
- cashier
- store
- city
- discount_card_used

You can simply paste the contents of the Python file into a Jupyter notebook
and start using it.

## Customizing

If you want to work with less rows or want to constrain the datetime range this
dataset generates feel free to change the code for your needs.

## Non realistic

The data and distribution of this dataset are not realistic. There's no data
missing. The number of products sold per row is randomized while in reality
you'd probably see a peak in this on low number of products.
